## Okay, Space Jam?

What started as a financially-wise purchase of spacejamming.com a few years ago, has now turned in to me rebuilding [spacejam.com](https://www.warnerbros.com/archive/spacejam/movie/jam.htm) as an offline-friendly, accessible, modern progressive web app (in React).

## Are you making it nice?

No. I'm just trying to build spacejam.com in a very modern way. I will probably add some animation because that's modern, but this is about preserving history.

## Is this livestreamed?

Maybe. I've been talking recently about live-streaming out the component build on Twitch or YouTube. But I'm working on how I can make that really different and fun from all the other streams there.

I tend to want to do something that pushes the platform and I'm not super feeling inspired by Twitch and YouTube at the moment.
